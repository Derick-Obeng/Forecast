## Weather API with Redis Caching

This project is a simple Weather API built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Redis**. It fetches weather data from the **Visual Crossing Weather API** and caches the results in Redis for better performance and reduced API usage.

### Features

- Fetch real-time weather data using the Visual Crossing API.
- Cache weather data in Redis with a 12-hour expiration time.
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.
- Graceful error handling for invalid city codes or third-party API failures.
